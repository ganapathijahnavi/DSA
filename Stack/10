Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.
The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:
"()" has score 1.
AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: 1

Example 2:
Input: s = "(())"
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: s = "()()"
Output: 2

Program:
def scoreOfParentheses(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        
        for ch in s:
            if ch == '(':
                stack.append(0)  
            else:
                val = 0
                while stack and stack[-1] != 0:
                    val += stack.pop()
                stack.pop()  
                stack.append(1 if val == 0 else 2 * val)

        return sum(stack)
