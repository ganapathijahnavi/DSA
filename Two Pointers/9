Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

 Program
 def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        i = 0
        j = i+1
        while i < len(nums) and j < len(nums):
            if(nums[j] <= nums[i]):
                temp = nums[i]
                nums[i] = nums[j]
                nums[j] = temp
                j += 1
            else:
                i += 1

        return nums
