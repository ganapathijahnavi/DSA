You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Program:
def arrangeCoins(self, n: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, n
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            curr = mid * (mid + 1) // 2 
            if curr == n:
                return mid  
            elif curr < n:
                l = mid + 1  
            else:
                r = mid - 1 
        return r
